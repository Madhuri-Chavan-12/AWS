# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) 

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that provides scalable, durable, and highly available storage for any amount of data.

- Used for backups, logs, media, static websites, artifacts, and data lakes

- Stores data as objects inside buckets

- Serverless (no infrastructure to manage)
---

### 1. Core Concepts
**1. Bucket**

- A container for objects

- Globally unique name

- Created in a specific AWS region


**2. Object**

- Actual data stored in S3

- Consists of:

   1. Object data (file)

  2. Key (path + filename)

  3. Metadata

**3. Key**

- Unique identifier for an object in a bucket

-----


### 2. Durability & Availability

- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines)

- Data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs

- High availability by default
---
### 3 . S3 Security

**1. Bucket Policy**

- Resource-based policy

- Written in JSON

- Controls access at bucket or object level

Example:
```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
```
**2. IAM Policy**

- Identity-based

- Attached to users, roles, or groups

- Controls who can access S3 and what actions they can perform

**3. Block Public Access**

- Enabled by default

- Prevents accidental public exposure

- Should only be disabled intentionally
---

### 4. S3 Versioning

- Keeps multiple versions of an object

- Protects against accidental deletion or overwrite

- Must be enabled at bucket level
---
### 5. S3 Encryption
**1. Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**

- SSE-S3 (AWS managed keys)

- SSE-KMS (KMS keys)

- SSE-C (customer-provided keys)

**2. Client-Side Encryption**

- Encrypt data before uploading to S3
---
### 6. S3 Lifecycle Rules

- Used to automatically transition or delete objects.

Example:
```
Move objects to Glacier after 30 days

Delete objects after 365 days
```
---
### 7. S3 Static Website Hosting

- Host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS)

- Requires:

  1. Public read access (or CloudFront)

  2. Index document (index.html)

  3. Optional error document

---

### 8. S3 Logging & Monitoring

**1. Server Access Logging**

- Records requests made to S3

- Stored in another S3 bucket

**2. CloudWatch**

- Metrics like request count, latency, errors

**3. CloudTrail**

- Tracks API calls for auditing
---

### 9. S3 Replication

**1. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**

- Replicates data to another AWS region

- Used for DR and compliance

**2. Same-Region Replication (SRR)**

- Replicates data within the same region
---
### 10. S3 Performance

- Supports high request rates

- Use multipart upload for large files

- No need to pre-create folders
